# Missing-element-of-AP

Find the missing element from an ordered array arr[], consisting of N elements representing an Arithmetic Progression(AP).

Note: There always exists an element which upon inserting into sequence forms Arithmetic progression. Boundary elements (first and last elements) are not missing.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 6
Arr[] = {2, 4, 8, 10, 12, 14}
Output: 6
Explanation: Actual AP should be 
2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14.

Example 2:

Input:
N = 6
Arr[] = {1, 6, 11, 16, 21, 31}
Output: 26
Explanation: Actual AP should be 
1, 6, 11, 16, 21, 26, 31.
